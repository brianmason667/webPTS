        set names for coloums for makeDataGrid() on admin-display.php page

        added
        <a href=/webpts/secure/log/error.html>error</a>
        <a href=/webpts/secure/log/access.html>access</a>

        make "new-production-actual.html" a php file, to let dropdown box get line select option from table

        changed name of the table "lines" to "assemblylines"
        so it could would work with the makeDataGrid() function
        i think everything that relied on this has been updated.

        downtime-modal.php , let dropdown box get machine select option from table
