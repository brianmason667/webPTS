    remove all php from copied forms

    set local jquery.js

    ok well you could have an PartsPerHour table. It would have an ID, a
    column for productionActualID, and 12 other columns for each hour. The hours
    would be int field and you would update that record through the day for each hour with the number
    produced that hour.

    Hourly is not working. working now

    multiple tables need created

    create table structure for assemblylines, defectcodes, downtimecodes



//TODOS
            
   
    make php to link multiple forms to the tables

    Currently you cannot have multiple productionactual running on same machine.(unless use incog window or seprate browser)



    sepreate line select by departments
    mounting, assembly, sensor

    


    when going over everything to remove php from copied fourms i knoticed line 55 registration.php has
    an set of php tags with only a "}" dose this do anything?
